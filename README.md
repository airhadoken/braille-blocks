This is braille-blocks, a Tetris variant (no automatic block falling) meant to be played with an 8-dot refreshable Braille display.

Each column of the 10x20 playfield is represented by a Braille character.  The left and right walls of the playfield are also represented.  In each column, the height of the topmost block is represented by the Braille for space (zero height), the digits 1-9 and 0 (height 1 to 10), or the letters A through J (height 11-20).

The current piece is displayed graphically to the right of the playfield.

Control keys:
* left arrow: move piece left
* right arrow: move piece right
* up arrow: rotate piece clockwise
* down arrow: drop piece
